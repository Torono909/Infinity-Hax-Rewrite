some changes have been made like for e.g.

> better security
> better packetfly
> constant updates

but those are only for the paid version for the public version there are:

> log4j security update
> better support on github
> more developers

and i hope you enjoy your public version if you havnt bought it yet.

*Note: dont download log4j, because we the devs are securing it from any other exploits.
